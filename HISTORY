RELEASE: dev
CHANGES:
1) dbsnpload.config - updated configured class names with new package
   name
2) ./data/fxnClass.vocab.in - added the 'within' vocab for 
   mgi determined snp/marker relationships
3) DBSNPInputProcessor.java - updated to with new package names in when
   checking for object types in the processInput method. Added call
   to SNPProcessor.getProcessed report to differentiate between those snps
   added to radar and mgd. e.g if a variation class can't be resolved, that
   snp will not be added to mgd, but will be added to radar, so counts can
   be different.
4) DBSNPLoader.java - catch SNPVocabResolverException in order to count them
   and to continue on to next RS when vocabs can't be resolved.
5) SNPProcessor.java - removed StrainKeyLookup since this is done in 
   DBSNPProcessor now. Added getProcessedReport method to return the count
    of snps loaded into mgd. Added try/catch when resolving vocabs in order
    to catch KeyNotFoundException and throw SNPVocabResolverException. Changed
    processSS method to processSubSnp for consistency. 
6) SNPVocabResolverException - new
