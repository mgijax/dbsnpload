RELEASE: alpha
CHANGES:
1) DBSNPLoader.java - log processing of ds chr to diag log as Info instead of 
   Debug
2) SNPProcessor.java use constant for SNP Strain MGI_Set._Set_key
3) dbsnpload.sh - log success failure to diag (as well as proc) log
4) loadTranslations.sh - log to new trans log in output directory instead of 
   LOG_DIAG - we may run this outside of the dbsnpload
5) loadVoc.sh and snpPopulation.sh - new logs for each.
6) ./data/fxnClass.goodbad - defect 418 - added reference translation
7) dbsnpload.config.default - updated  COORD_TYPE to "SNP"

RELEASE: 3rd dev build
CHANGES:
1) removed old translation config files that were renamed
2) dbsnpload.sh - reordered vocloads to create new vocab keys in correct order
3) SNPProcessor.java - prepend rsId and ssId with rs and ss respectively
		- prepend rsId with 'rs' for coordload input file
                - add prefixPart and NumericPart to ACC_Accession
4) PopNameByPopIdLookup.java, HandleNameByPopIdLookup.java 
    - updated to use constants rather than hardcoded keys
5) rmvd simple fxnClass vocab configfile and datafile; replaced with DAG version
6) loadVoc.sh - updated to use DAG vocload for fxnClass
7) dbsnpload.config - added VOCDAGLOAD

2) subHandleVocab.config, fxnClassVocab.config and varClassVocab.config - 
	add subdir to RUNTIME_DIR
3) call translationload.py directly from dbsnpload.sh
   instead of calling varClass.csh and fxnClass.csh 
   wrappers in translationload product.
4) fxnClassTrans.config, varClassTrans.config - new
5) ./data/varClass.vocab.in - added definitions of vor the varClass vocab

   variation class

RELEASE: dev
CHANGES:
1) removed dbsnpload.config, added dbsnpload.config.default
2) dbsnpload.sh - removed old runtruncate function
3) SNP.java - added code to add MGI_Set for uniq set of strain keys
4) SNPProcessor.java - added code to add MGI_Set for uniq set of strain keys

RELEASE: dev
CHANGES:
1) dbsnpload.config - updated configured class names with new package
   name
2) ./data/fxnClass.vocab.in - added the 'within' vocab for 
   mgi determined snp/marker relationships
3) DBSNPInputProcessor.java - updated to with new package names in when
   checking for object types in the processInput method. Added call
   to SNPProcessor.getProcessed report to differentiate between those snps
   added to radar and mgd. e.g if a variation class can't be resolved, that
   snp will not be added to mgd, but will be added to radar, so counts can
   be different.
4) DBSNPLoader.java - catch SNPVocabResolverException in order to count them
   and to continue on to next RS when vocabs can't be resolved.
5) SNPProcessor.java - removed StrainKeyLookup since this is done in 
   DBSNPProcessor now. Added getProcessedReport method to return the count
    of snps loaded into mgd. Added try/catch when resolving vocabs in order
    to catch KeyNotFoundException and throw SNPVocabResolverException. Changed
    processSS method to processSubSnp for consistency. 
6) SNPVocabResolverException - new
