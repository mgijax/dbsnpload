* toc_templateTOC.fm - template for the table of contents. To rebuild the TOC -
   this is courtesy of Diane, and is for the Windows version of Frame.
   1. Open the doc you want to create a TOC for. NOTE: to toggle
      between/among open docs, use Window menu & select doc name to
      bring to foreground. Docs must be open to show up on the list.
   2. In doc needing TOC, go to Special-->Table of Contents. For
      "Standalone?" click Yes.
   3. In box that appears, click *1Section*, click arrow to move it to
      the left. Repeat for *2Section,* & *3Section*, if desired. (I only
      formatted down to the 3rd level in the TOC template I sent you. If
      you need a 4Section, let me know). Check "create hypertext links?"
      Click Set.
   4. TOC doc shows up in your window....UNFORMATTED. Click
      File-->Import-->Formats--Import from Document and & select the TOC
      template. Leave all the check marks (or click everything if those
      check marks don't appear). Click Import.
   5. The resulting doc should have the new formats BUT the page numbers
      will not be right justified...YET. Save this document. It should
      have the name of your original document (i.e., foo) with TOC
      appended to it (i.e., fooTOC.fm).
   6. Go to the Window menu & bring the original to the fore (i.e.,
      foo). Regenerate the TOC (follow steps 3&4). NOW the fooTOC.fm doc
      should reappear with right-justified  numbering with ellipses
      leading to the page numbers. If not, you have to screw around with
      the reference page. Let me know if this happens & I'll tell you how.

      Whenever you change the original & want to regenerate a TOC, don't 
      forget to save, save, save everything.
